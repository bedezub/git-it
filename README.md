# Git It

Hi there! **Git It** is the best way to understand the way to push projects into Github. 
Most programmers would probably now about this, but it is good to have a quick recap on pushing or pulling the codes from Github

Usually, I prefer to type the commands when pushing my project to the repository. 
However, since I have Github Desktop installed in my computer and Visual Studio Code with Github extension. 
I found it much more convenient to use on daily basis.

There are several text files in the repo. 

* intialCommit.txt
* uploadNewFile.txt
* uploadFileNoChangeOthers.txt
* pullRequest.txt
* cloneProject.txt
* succesful.txt
* markdownSample.md

--- 

Based on my understanding, the cycle of push codes into the repository

*intialCommit.txt* -> *uploadNewFileNoChangeOthers.txt*

and pulling and pushing it again

*pullingRequest.txt* -> *cloneProject.txt*

I did followed a Youtube tutorial on how to get it done. 
But cloning project to my desktop is much more simpler using Github Desktop/Web with a few clicks of a button.

**Additional new file** , *markdownSample.md*.

I am learning on how to write a markdownm, *.md*. I believe, every project should have a little documentation for other programmers to understand it better.

Referring to this video, [Markdown Syntax | In One Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JE66WFpaII "Mike did a cool video on markdown. Please check him out!"). 
I managed to write a cool documentation like this one. Clean and Simple. I like it that way!
