Hello guys. I am just learning on how to make git commit. 

Might as well to share with you guys! 

Here are the steps:

git init
git add -A "< Write something in here >"
git commit -m "
git remote add origin < Add your repo link here >
git push -f -u origin master

Okay, assume we have create new file to upload in the repo.
